# パズそば (Puzzle & Dragon solver)
I have been playing this game for more than 2000 days and it is also around the time when I started programming. Lots of great memories. 

I don't know if this is even gonna work or not but I want to try it out.

## Compile
This is written on a windows computer so it is using `mingw`. On Mac or Linux, you need to have `g++` and `make`.
~~~shell
$ mingw32-make.exe
~~~

## Resources
I will some more resources and probably see how others solve this problem.
