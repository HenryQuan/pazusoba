# Automation
Currently, I am using `scrcpy` to mirror and control my phone. This way, I can simply capture a screenshot and get board easily.

### iOS
Maybe try https://er.run/. I will try it after everything is working properly.

It seems that `wormhole` is paid for iOS but the there is an alternative called `Dell Mobile Connect`. It also works for Android so it is all in one.
