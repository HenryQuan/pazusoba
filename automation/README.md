# Automation
This is the ultimate goal for pazusoba, solving the puzzle and performing the solution. `scrcpy` is used to mirror and control my Android devices. For iOS devices, `Dell Mobile Connect` can be used.

## Setup
***The automation project is only for education purpose.*** `DO NOT` use it for any other purposes.

~~~shell
$ cd ../
$ mingw32-make.exe python
~~~
Move `pazusoba` to `automation` folder. Then, you can start using the program.
