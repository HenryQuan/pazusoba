# Game
This is a collection of game elements. They are used to indicate current game state and based on what is visible on screen, different actions will be performanced.

- back: tap on this button and terminate (this is shown when you are out of stamina)
- challenge: this is visible right before entering the dungeon
- dungeon: one of five bottom tabs (can be used to go back to dungeon)
- home: visible in home screen (magic stone and coin are always on top)
- ok: when a dungeon is cleared or game over (TODO: double check for dungeons you can revive)
- rewards: collecting rewards after cleared a dungeon
- select: select a friend
- sell: visible when all rewards are given
- special: the entry of special dungeons
- target: the current target dungeon (TODO: should be updated)
- you: my own leader (not a friend's leader)
